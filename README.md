# Analyzing Macro-Economy of the World
 
This app is built to analyze IMF's macroeconomic data on world economies. Built using streamlit and python.

### My purpose for building this app? 
I was doing a course on Macro-economics, and thought of building an analytics tool that can help me understand world's economies for completing the course projects. I built this so I can use it in the future as well.


### Run:
The app is running on streamlit cloud and can be accessed here: [Macro-Economy Analyzer app](https://macroeconomy-analyzer.streamlit.app/)

**To run it locally:**
1. Install the python packages mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file. 
2. Then run the following command from the console: `streamlit run app/home.py`

The app should open in your web browser.


Hope it finds good use to you!
